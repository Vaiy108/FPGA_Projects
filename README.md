# FPGA Projects — VHDL / Xilinx ISE (Spartan-6)

This repository contains a collection of FPGA projects developed in VHDL and targeted to the **Numato Lab Mimas V2 (Spartan-6 XC6LX9)** board.  
The projects range from basic combinational and sequential circuits to more advanced digital design and signal processing systems.

## Target Hardware
- Board: Numato Lab **Mimas V2**
- FPGA: Xilinx Spartan-6 XC6LX9
- Tools: Xilinx ISE, ISim, ModelSim
- Language: VHDL
